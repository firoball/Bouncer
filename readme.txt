Bouncer
-------

Bouncer is a single player game of skills.
Unlike other games, this game requires a Nintendo
Wiimote for playing.

This game was created for the Qantm game contest 2008.
Full source is included. Feel free to modify, improve,
reuse it.
All files included in the "media" subfolder are NOT
allowed to be used for commercial products.


Wiimote
-------

This game is played using a Nintendo Wiimote.
It can be connected just like any Bluetooth device.
It does not require an accesskey, though.

Connection should work with Bluesoleil stack,
MS stack, and all compatibles.

Important: Connect the Wiimote to your PC BEFORE
starting the game.


How to play
-----------

Your task is to collect all crystal shards using a
small blue ball during a limited time period.
Instead of moving the ball directly, you have to 
tilt the level in order to get the ball moving.
Additionally you're allowed to boost into any desired
direction every few seconds

Tilt and Roll the Wiimote to tilt the level.
By quickly moving the Wiimote into a direction, the
ball will be accelerated.


Lessons learned
----------------

- Basic usage of Newton Game Dynamics
- Writing and improving Wiimote access code
- How to write a Gamestudio MDL loader
- Dark GDK basic knowledge
- Usage of Terragen
- .x model format sucks!!!

Legal
-----

I have rights for all graphics and music files
used in this game.
Wiimote and HID code base were released as
public domain by other people. The versions used
by the game however were heavily modified,
improved, rewritten, bugfixed and beautified :) 
by myself.


Game was written within 2.5 months. This is a
maybe 30% version of what I really wanted to deliver.
No crystals were harmed during development.
Have fun playing!

No more time left...


Addendum 04/2017
